Data Structures and Algorithms Lab

Lab 1
-----

The first lab is meant as a C++ referesher and asks you to
implement a simpe functionality within a class. The class
specification is provided---basically, a class file that
initializes and stores an array and provides some custom
functionality.

The provided files are: myArray.h 
You should implmented: myArray.cpp

The lab has a set of exercises that incrementally tests 
the specified functionality of each member function.
You should checkpoint your implmentation against each
of the exerice testcases.

The exercise testcases are labeled ex1, ex2 etc. and are
stored in separate directories.
Each exercise directory has a main program and a file to
show reprsentative expected output of the program.

Note: The exercise testcases do not test all the specfied
functionality, but are meant to test your implementation
for the provided programs only. Separate testcase will be
used to check actual correctnesss and handling of cornes
cases etc.
